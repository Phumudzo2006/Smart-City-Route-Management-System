!# Smart City Route Management System

## Author
- **Name:** Phumudzo Matshaya
  
A C++ Smart City Route Management System demonstrating graph algorithms,
Dijkstra’s shortest path, and explainable AI concepts.

## Description
This project is a **Smart City Route Management System** implemented in **C++**.  
It models a city road network using a **weighted graph** and applies **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute optimal routes based on distance, travel time, or cost.

The system also integrates **Explainable AI (XAI)** principles by providing step-by-step explanations of routing decisions, including optional AI-based congestion prediction.

## Features
- Add, remove, update, and display routes
- Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Optimization by distance, time, or cost
- AI-based congestion adjustment (peak vs off-peak hours)
- Explainable routing decisions (XAI)
- Search and sort routes
- Interactive console menu

## 🔹 Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates:
- Strong C++ fundamentals
- Use of STL containers and algorithms
- Graph theory and shortest-path algorithms
- Clean software design
- Explainable AI principles

## Technologies Used
- C++
- STL (`map`, `vector`, `priority_queue`, `set`)
- Graph algorithms (Dijkstra)

## How to Compile and Run

###  Build & Run
```bash
g++ src/SmartCityRouteManagement.cpp -o smart_city
./smart_city

A C++ project that simulates intelligent route planning in a smart city
using graph algorithms and explainable AI concepts.
